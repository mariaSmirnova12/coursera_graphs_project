In this application the back end of a mapping application was created. (A front end that uses the Google Maps API was provided.)
- Graph structures were implemented
- Fundamental graph algorithms for finding shortest path were implemented:
    - *Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm*
    - *Dijkstra's algorithm* (through a weighted graph)
    - *A-Star algorithm*
